  //This method is meant to return a random fact from the facts array. It doesn't take any parameters and returns a string (a fact in form of a string).
  func randomFact() -> String {
    
    // assigning a random number from the GKRandomSource class and call a class/type method on it called shareRandom() which returns an instance of this class. Now we have an instance to work with. We could assign this instance to a constant and work with that constant but since we already have an instance to work with we can call a method on it directly. The nextInt method w/ upperBound arrgument returns a random number for the upper range you pass in. So if I pass in the number 10 which is the number of facts in the facts array it would generate a random number from 0-10. That works but it also limits the range to 10 by hard coding that number, so if I add another fact to the array I will never see it because 10 is no longer the upper bound number. Instead pass in the number of items in the array using the count method.
    let randomNumber = GKRandomSource.sharedRandom().nextInt(upperBound: facts.count)
    
    return facts[randomNumber]
  }
}
